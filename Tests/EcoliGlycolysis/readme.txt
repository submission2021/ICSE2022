This directory contains the ecoli glycolysis subject tests.

For the invariant tests (F, IN, F+IN, INwRC, IR, F+IN+IR),
All use the same input file, Input-INVAR.csv, since these tests have no constraints on the input.
Each test suite does require its own InputIDs-*.csv to map the inputs to the abstrast tests.
Each test suite has its own Tests-*.csv to define the properties the invariants stated. 
All invaraint tests are functional or internal tests in our study.
